# RECIPE  
ingredients:
    Main:
        - 300ml Extra virgin olive oil
        - 200ml Virgin olive oil
        - 100ml Truffle oil
        - 1 egg yolk
        - Tablespoon of Dijon mustard
        - Rock Salt
        - Pepper
        - Lemon Juice
        - 1 Head of smoked garlic - roasted in the oven

instructions:
    1. (15 min):
        -  Wrap the head of garlic in foil and roast in the oven at 120c until it is soft.
    2. (05 min): 
        - Squeeze out your softened, smoked garlic head into a bowl with the egg yolk and mustard. The garlic should be a puree-like texture. Mix these things together til you have a smooth paste. Start to whisk in your oils bit by bit and you will see the mixture start to thicken.
    3. (10 min):
        - Once you have mixed in a quarter of the oil, you can then start to add it in larger quantities. Keep whisking the mixture until it starts to resemble a mayonnaise-like texture. At this point you can add the lemon juice and salt and pepper. Whisk in the lemon juice.
    4. (05 min):
        - Decant into a large, airtight jar and store in the fridge.
       
note: "There's nothing like a good, robust aioli to serve with fish and anything deep fried.  This is far better than any shop bought version and about a quarter of the price. You can make flavour additions as you like (e.g. paprika or coriander seeds) when you add in your lemon juice. I like to use smoked garlic for an extra depth of flavour and lemon juice to give an extra tang. I would recommend whisking by hand to offset the calorie intake of the deep fried delicacies you are likely to consume with your aioli."
