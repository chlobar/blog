# RECIPE  
ingredients:
    Main:
        - 100g fine cornmeal (polenta)
        - 65g Tapioca Starch
        - 60g Millet Flour (or chickpea flour)
        - 2 ½ tsp xanthan gum
        - 100g eggs (approximately 2 large eggs)
        - 75g egg yolks (about 5)
        - 1 tbs olive oil
        - 1 tsp salt

instructions:
    1. (01 min):
        - Mix the flours, xanthan gum and salt in a food mixer.
    2. (02 min): 
        - Add the eggs, egg yolks and olive oil.
    3. (02 min):
        - Mix until the mixture comes together into a ball. It should be slightly sticky to the touch. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for 1 hour.
    4. (15 min): 
        - To make tagliatelle break off small sausage shaped pieces and roll the dough out into longer sausage shapes by hand. Rest it for a few minutes, then roll out again and flatten with a rolling pin, or, (if you have) use a pasta machine to roll out thinner.
    5. (10 min): 
        - Leave the dough to rest a few minutes in between, so that it dries a little and doesn’t stick to the rollers.
    6. (05 min):
        - Fresh pasta will take between 4 and 5 minutes to cook in boiling salted water. Make sure to have plenty of water, you will need at least 1 litre per 100g of pasta.
