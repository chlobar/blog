# RECIPE  
ingredients:
    Main:
        - 175g Gluten Free Self Raising Flour
        - 75g Finely Desiccated Coconut
        - 150g Sugar
        - 110g Butter/Soya Spread
        - 2 Large Eggs
        - 1 large pineapple, cored and cubed
        - 2 Tsp Bicarbonate of Soda
        - 2 Tsp Vanilla Extract
        - 1 Red Chilli, Finely Chopped
        - Zest of 4 limes
    Lime-and-chilli-syrup:
        - 4 Tablespoons runny honey
        - 30g Muscovado sugar
        - 2 Tsp ground chilli flakes
        - Zest and juice of 4 limes
        
instructions:
    1. (15 min):
        - Line a large baking tray with foil and spray with spray oil/grease with butter. Core and chop the pineapple into even-sized cubes. Scatter the cubes of pineapple onto the greased tray. Roast for 15 minutes at 140c or until the pineapple cubes are slightly caramelised.
    2. (05 min): 
        - Put the sifted flour, desiccated coconut and bicarbonate of soda into a mixing bowl. Deseed and finely chop the chilli.Cream the butter and sugar, adding in the 2 eggs, the zest of the 4 limes, chopped chilli and vanilla extract.
    3. (05min):
        - Mix the dry ingredients into the wet until you have a smooth, thick batter. Fold in the roasted pineapple chunks and mix in. Transfer to a large loaf tin/24cm round cake tin. Put into oven at 180c for 25 minutes or until cake has risen and is springy to touch. Take out of oven and allow to cool.
    4. (05 min): 
        - "To make the syrup: Add the honey, sugar, ground chilli flakes, lime juice and lime zest to a small pan and heat gently until slightly bubbling and reduce until you have a syrupy texture."
    5. (35 min): 
        - "Prick cake with fork in several places and pour syrup over liberally. Leave the syrup to sink in and then eat."


note: "I do love a good pineapple. Sweet, juicy and full of the fragrance of a tropical holiday - more often than not, the closest I'm going to get to one. There always seems to be a deal of 2 for 2 pounds, or buy 2 get 1 free when I make my Tesco order and inevitably I am left with a lonely overripe pineapple, looking forlornly at me from my counter next to my bowl of limes and chillies. So, in a culinary 'Eureka' moment I decided it'd be a good idea to try and make a cake combining said pineapple with some lime and chilli. And chuck in some coconut for a (sorry, couldn't stop myself quoting the old 'Lilt' ad) totally tropical taste. What really makes this cake is roasting the pineapple cubes as this really makes the pineapple flavour pop. It's quite a dense cake what with a whole pineapple folded in, so I like to cut it into fun-sized cubes (and then proceed to eat about 10...)"
