# RECIPE  
ingredients:
    Main:
        - 60g gluten free flour (Doves Farm)
        - 60g tapioca flour
        - 60g ground almonds
        - 60g polenta flour
        - 2 tsp salt
        - 100ml warm water
        - 100ml cider vinegar
        - 4 tbsp olive oil
    Seeds:
        - 30g Black sesame seeds
        - 30g White sesame seeds
        - 30g Golden Linseeds
        - 30g Sunflower seeds
  
instructions:
    1. (01 min):
        - Preheat oven to 180ºC. 
    2. (02 min): 
        - Combine all the dry ingredients (including the seeds) into a large bowl and mix well 
    3. (03 min):
        - Mix the cider vinegar, olive oil and the warm water together in a pyrex jug and slowly pour the mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients, stiring the mixture with a wooden spoon until it starts to stick together and form a dough. It should hold together but not be too sticky. If it is too dry, then add a little more olive oil and warm water until it is the right consisteny.
    4. (04 min): 
        - Gather the dough into a ball and take out of the bowl. Lay out a large piece of silicone baking paper and start to roll it out flat. Roll in out into a square shape, trying to make it as thin and even as possible.
    5. (05 min): 
        - Trim off any excess dough to give nice neat edges and then cut it horizontally and then across to give oblong cracker shapes.
    6. (06 min): 
        - Carefully lift the dough on the baking paper onto a flat, square baking tray ready to put in the oven.
    7. (06 min):
        - Put it in the oven for 15 - 20 minutes, until it has turned a golden colour.
    8. (20 min): 
        - Take the tray out of the oven and allow to cool before separating your crackers, ready to be dipped, spreaded or enjoyed solo.

note: "As a serious fromageophile - particularly strong, runny, fragrant and unpasteurized such as Epoisses, Vacherin or Chaource - something I always crave is a light, thin crispbread or cracker upon which to spread such wonderous curds and whey. Although I am generally as happy as a sandboy (or should I say girl) if given some grapes, apple slices and fine chutney, pâtés are something, which really can't be consumed without a firm foundation underfoot. I am partial to a pâté - as you will see from my spiced roast salmon pâté recipe. Most gluten free crackers generally look and taste like sawdust, not to mention that they crumble under any attempt to spread with a topping. So I decided it was about time I came up with my own cracker incarnation. The combination of tapioca, ground almond and polenta give the dough enough moisture to prevent it from crumbling, whilst the rice flour gives is its crisp."
