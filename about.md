## What Is Glutenus Minimus?
Glutenus Minimus is the lovechild of a decade of gluten intolerance and a lifetime of gastronomy. Glutenus Minimus is dedicated to charting my gluten-free culinary creations as I continue to learn, discover and create viable (and equally tasty) alternatives.

## About Me

I am North-Londoner who lives South of the river, within striking distance of the gastronimic goldmine that is Borough Market. Having grown up in a well-travelled cosmopolitan Jewish family, food (from all corners of the globe) has played a fundamental part of my life. From making multicoloured cakes from my Osbourneâ€™s First Cookbook to my first souffle, food has provided both challenge and joy. When discovering discomforting symptoms that turned out to be a gluten intolerance, this served as further fuel for my gastronomic and gluttonous voyage of discovery.
